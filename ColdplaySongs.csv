Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on,
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on,
Not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on,
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through

And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you
Yeah I do
Woohoo
Woohoo

Amazing day

Where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away

Studying the lights
The dreaming of escape
Will keep you up at night

But someone had put the flare up
Got me in rays
So... I guess I better stay

""Uh uh, no come on!"" you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just warning rain
Don't let the fears just start, what if
I won't see you again
Around here you never want to
Sleep all night

So start falling in love,
Start the riot
And come on rage with me

We don't need words
We'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on, all for love
Out from the underground

Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
We'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Fearless through this you said
We'll go
Through this together (ooohh)
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool"
5,Everglow.txt,"Oh they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we died
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

6,Fun.txt,"[Coldplay:]
I know it's over before she says
I know it falls at the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits
For a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

[Coldplay:]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves

We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin

Don't see me give in

Don't say we're done

And two force, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over,
Fight 'til it's done

Don't say it was all a waste

Before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
Up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying,
""Sitting with the poison takes away the pain.""

Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart, oh

Yes, I wanna grow, yes, I wanna feel
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up, oh

Try and see the forest, there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love

When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

But you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say, ""It's mine,"" and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

Sick to the stomach

All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
Just want a way of keeping you inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Oh yeah yeah yeah
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts

My arms turn wings,
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds.

Might have to go where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
And I won't show or fear any pain,
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

A simple plot but I know one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot but I know one day
Good things are coming our way,
Oh, yeah...

I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie
Lie to me

Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

Call it true love
Call it true

Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet,
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free,
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene,
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

In my scarecrow dreams,
When they smash my heart into smithereens,
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete.
Be a cartoon heart,
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart.
We'll run wild,
We'll be glowing in the dark.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

We'll be glowing in the dark.

All the boys, all the girls,
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls,
All the madness that occurs.
All the highs, all the lows,
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot,
We'll be glowing in the dark.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

So we'll soar luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark."

When you're tired of racing and you
Found you never left the start
Come on baby, dont let it break your heart

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball.
And a slowly burning tide (oh)
Through my veins is flowing.
From my shipwreck I heard her call
And she sang

When you're tired of aiming your arrows,
Still you never hit the mark
And even if your aims are shadows
Still we're never gonna part

Come on baby don't let it break your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh
Dont let it break your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh
Dont let it break your heart

I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart stop beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this light I swear you'll,
Emerge blinking into to tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Ah
Is a waterfall
Ah ah ah
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Ah ah ah

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Every door I ever tried was locked

Just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost

Every gun you ever held went off

This heavy load 

Locusts will 
Lift me up 
Im just a prisoner 
In a reign of love 

Locusts will 
Let us stop 
I wish Id spoken 
To the reign of love 

Reign of love 
By the church, were waiting 
Reign of love 
My knees go praying 

How I wish 
Id spoken up 
Or wed be carried 
In the reign of love.

From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God

Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft

Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below.

So if you love me, why d'you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

Said if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?

Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead long live the king
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St Peter won't call my name

of us in the daylight

Saying Lord lead me not into temptation 
But its not easy when she turns you on 
Sin, stay gone 

If youd only, if youd only say yes 
Whether you will's anybodys guess 
God only God knows I'm trying my best 
But Im just so tired of this loneliness 

Hey 

So up they picked me by the big toe 
I was held from the rooftop then they let go 
Dizzily screaming 'Let the windows down' 
As I crawl to the ground 

If you'd only if you'd only say yes 
Whether you will's anybody's guess
